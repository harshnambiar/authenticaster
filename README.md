# what the authenticaster ratings mean  
Scores are given out of 10.  
10: The project and the launcher appear to have the highest possible level of credibility  and there is a lot of attention being received by the project.  Such project have the highest likelihood of being authentic.  
8-9: The project and the launcher have high credibility but the interest in the project needs to be gauged for a longer period before coming to a concrete conclusion. Alternately, there is a lot of interest in the project but the launcher or the project have a medium level credibility score.  Such projects have a high probability of being authentic.  
6-7: The project and the launcher have medium credibility rating along with the project receiving moderate public interest. Alternately, the project or the launcher have a poor credibility score but the project has gained significant attention, or the project lacks much hype, but the launcher and the project have a very high credibility score.  Such projects have nearly an equal likelohood of being or not being authentic.  
3-5: The project has received very low attention, and the launcher and the project have a medium credibility score. Alternatively, the project has received moderate attention, but the launcher or the project have a low credibility score. Such projects have a lower probability of being legitimate.  
0-4: The project hasn't generated much hype at all, and the project and the launcher (usually both) have a low credibility score. Financially engaging with such a project should be done at ones own risk.
